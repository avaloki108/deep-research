## 🔒 Vulnerability Research Examples

### Example 1: DeFi Protocol Research

```bash
npm start
```

Select mode: `2` (Vulnerability research)

Query: `uniswap v3 liquidity pool vulnerabilities`

This will:
- Find Uniswap-related bug bounty programs
- Scan GitHub for Uniswap v3 repositories
- Analyze smart contracts for common vulnerabilities
- Generate a comprehensive security report

### Example 2: Static Analysis Only

```bash
npm run test:analysis
```

This demonstrates the static analysis engine with a sample vulnerable contract containing:
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Access control issues
- Weak randomness
- tx.origin usage
- And more...

### Example 3: Demo Run

```bash
npm run demo:vuln
```

Runs a demonstration of the complete vulnerability research pipeline.

## 🛡️ Vulnerability Categories Detected

The static analysis engine detects 16+ vulnerability types:

### Critical Severity
- **Reentrancy Attacks**: External calls before state changes
- **Delegatecall Vulnerabilities**: Dangerous delegatecall usage

### High Severity
- **Access Control Issues**: tx.origin usage, unprotected functions
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Arithmetic vulnerabilities
- **Price Oracle Manipulation**: Oracle-related vulnerabilities
- **Flash Loan Attack Vectors**: Flash loan exploitation patterns
- **Suicide/Selfdestruct Usage**: Dangerous contract destruction

### Medium Severity
- **Weak Randomness**: Block properties for randomness
- **Front-Running Vulnerabilities**: MEV-susceptible functions
- **Gas Limit DoS**: Unbounded loops
- **Approval Race Conditions**: ERC20 approval issues
- **Unchecked Low-Level Calls**: Unhandled send/transfer

### Low Severity
- **Uninitialized Storage**: Storage pointer issues
- **Block Timestamp Dependency**: Time-based logic vulnerabilities

## 📊 Research Methodology

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Scrape 4 major bug bounty platforms
   - Search GitHub with smart queries
   - Filter by stars, bounty indicators, relevance

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Download and parse smart contract source code
   - Run static analysis with 16+ vulnerability patterns
   - Calculate confidence scores and risk ratings

3. **Prioritization Phase**
   - Weight by bounty rewards ($0 - $500k+)
   - Factor in repository metrics (stars, activity)
   - Combine with vulnerability findings

4. **Reporting Phase**
   - Generate comprehensive markdown reports
   - Include actionable recommendations
   - Provide clear next steps for researchers
